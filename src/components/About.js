        <h2>What is a Great Grate?</h2>
        <p>
          Not all of you may live in a shellfish Utopia similar to coastal Rhode
          Island as I do, so here’s a few tips that may help you better enjoy
          these tasty morsels and save you some work. The heat on the adductor
          muscles determines if the “meats” of your clams, oysters or mussels
          are going to be attached to the upper or lower shell when the cooking
          is done. The “in shell” cooking adds flavors that steaming steals as
          well as retains the delicious juices that are usually diluted or lost.
          Be sure to discard any shellfish that do not open!

          When cooking fresh unopened oysters on a grill or in an oven, begin by
          placing each cupped shell level on an opening in the GreatGrate. When
          the shell opens about 1/8” the oyster is cooked. Then the top shell
          must be removed by sliding a sharp knife into the opening along the
          top shell to cut the adductor muscle. Be careful not to burn
          yourself!. I usually avoid doing so by holding the oyster steady with
          a towel. I think the taste, presentation and topping options are
          considerably greater if prior to cooking, the oysters are opened,
          saving the the juices and meats. Then, positioning the shells level on
          your GG and top with recipe ingredients of your choice. See my website
          recipes for additional ideas or consider contacting me personally to
          purchase an exclusive online version of the “Ol Swamper's” shellfish
          cookbook which contains 84 pages of recipes and cooking tips for only
          ten bucks or a beautiful signed printed copy is $15 plus $4 S&H.

          Clams, unlike oysters, have equally cupped shells, so simply put
          unopened clams on the GG so they are level and they will open wide
          when done. The entire grate can be removed by inserting tongs into the
          slots on the sides of the GG. You can usually control where the cooked
          clam is going to be located by the altering the cooking procedure. As
          mentioned earlier, the side of the clam subjected to the most intense
          heat while cooking is going cause the muscles on that side to release
          from the shell. Using shells of about the same size will result in
          their cooking at the same rate if your heat source is even. As with
          oysters I like to shuck the clams first for a greater variety of taste
          and presentation. Placing unopened fresh shellfish on your GrateGrate
          in a closed grill chamber over a med/low (350deg.) heat source or
          indirect heat source will cause most of the meats to drop into the
          lower shell. When I'm cooking for hordes of hungry slurpees at seafood
          gatherings I often will place the medium(triangular) or small
          (hexagonal) loaded GreatGrates on the upper warming rack of the gas
          grill with the cover down. With the lid of the grill closed the top of
          the cooking chamber is hottest so the adductor muscles will cook and
          drop the meat into the lower shell. When inside using an oven on
          broiler setting, the meats will always remain in the lower shell due
          to the heat source coming from above which cooks the top shell’s
          adductor muscles first.
          <br />
          <br />
          Remember, discard any that do not open! Serving your raw oysters and
          clams on your Great Grate will eliminate the need for crushed ice and
          if the GG is chilled will help keep them cold. If refrigerating your
          product before cooking you can use your GreatGrate to keep the shells
          level so they don't lose their juices, & they'll retain freshness for
          weeks or more. Thank you for your purchase. I hope this gives you some
          new insights on how to better enjoy cooking with your GreatGrate and
          enhance the flavors of these tasty and tender gems of the sea.
