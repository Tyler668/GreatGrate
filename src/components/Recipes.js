        <h2> Tips for using your Shell Fish Lover’s Model </h2>
        <p>
          Congratulations, you’ve made a Great Grate model choice that will cook
          and serve dozens of your favorite shellfish for many years to come.
          You’ll cook like a professional with this model which is used in many
          restaurants for cooking dozens of shellfish. It’s sized to fit on most
          grills and also to fit perfectly in a cookie sheet to allow for use in
          your kitchen oven and provide an any time of year cooking experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          This Shellfish Lovers models design requires an even heat source for
          best results. Many grills and ovens have “hot spots” which may cause
          temporary distortion due to this uneven distribution of heat. You can
          expect the best results by lowering the temperature or moving the
          Grate Grate away from the flame to minimize this situation. Your
          shellfish will still be delicious but will take a bit longer to cook
          and if distortion does occur, don’t worry, your grate will return to
          its usual shape when it cools.
          <br />
          <br />
          An added use for this model is that it can be used to store dozens of
          your fresh shellfish prior to use. Simply place your shells level on
          the GreatGrate, sprinkle them liberally with cold water (or cover with
          a wet towel) then place the loaded grate on a cookie sheet inside a
          plastic bag and put the entire unit in the refrigerator until you’re
          ready to cook. Of course the freshest products always tastes best but
          you’ll have a difficult time tell the freshest from the stored if you
          follow the above suggestion. Oysters will store for weeks and clams
          (hard shell) for many days because they won’t desiccate as rapidly.
          But remember if a clam or oyster doesn’t open after cooking *throw it
          out!!!* Hope these ideas add to your cooking pleasure and enjoyment of
          your Great Grate. Slurp On and thank you.

            open. (Discard any that do not open.) Rough chop clams in processor
            or run through a grinder. Melt butter and sauté onions and bell
            peppers until onions they are opaque and still firm. Add stuffing,
            breadcrumbs, whiskey, salt, pepper, Tabasco Sauce and mix well. Add
            clam juice to moisten. Wash shells and stuff with mix. Sprinkle
            lightly with paprika for color. Bake in preheated 325 ̊F oven for 30
            to 40 minutes. Serve hot. Serves 12. Variation: Make with
            littlenecks or cherrystones and serve as appetizers.
